Code for postural analysis of Cowbird CSD 

This is still a little messy, I'm working on cleaning it up

The most important files are the ManuscriptAnalysis-Final.ipynb and SupplementalAnalysis.ipynb
For those to run, you'll also need the pose data files, which you can find on googledrive currently:

See also the keypoint detection repo at https://github.com/aperkes/keypoint_detection_public 

I'll work on getting the data to a more permenent better and making everything more stable. 
Email me if something doesn't work.
